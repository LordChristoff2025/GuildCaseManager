# GuildCaseManager (A Work in Progress)
A world of Warcraft Addon

Welcome to GuildCaseManager. 

An addon brought to life from the player known as Magnussen on Argent Dawn EU, the idea being that a dedicated RP-based addon was needed for in game usage. While systems such as Discord and Google Docs allow users to keep track of events externally, GuildCaseManager provides functionailty while in game. 

# Such as (but not limited to):
- Cases: Manage investigations and track their progress
- People: Keep profile on known individuals for usage at a later time 
- Map: Mark important locations and connect the dots
- Staff: Current staff of the guild
- GJLE: Gilneas Judicary Law Enforcement hub
- Krin Tor: A Hub for everything relating to the Kirin Tor
- Sync: The addon sync's across guild members so everyone is upto date.

Open with /acdb or show the welcome message with /acdbw

# Planned features: 
- Evidnce board for laying out evidence found
- Evidence window, which acts in the same way as "cases" and "People" but for evidence instead.
- Maybe a dedicated message zone for detective-based communications

# To be fixed
- Sync doesn't work correctly
- Map interface does work to an extent but not in the way envisioned
- Side buttons have two textures
- Window can be rezied unproportionally to the content it holds
- Staff window has intended features missing

# Sidenotes

I'm aware there's no doubt better ways to do stuff in LUA, however I am no expert and it works for now.
