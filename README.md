# GuildCaseManager (A Work in Progress)
A world of Warcraft Addon

Welcome to GuildCaseManager. 

While the code is developed the addon's core functionality resolves around immersion and being able to build case files while in game to support detcetive based RP. 

# Such as (but not limited to):
- Cases: Manage investigations and track their progress
- People: Keep profile on known individuals for usage at a later time 
- Map: Mark important locations and connect the dots
- Staff: Current staff of the guild
- GJLE: Gilneas Judicary Law Enforcement hub
- Krin Tor: A Hub for everything relating to the Kirin Tor
- Sync: The addon sync's across guild members so everyone is upto date.

Open with /acdb or show the welcome message with /acdbw

# Planned features: 
- Evidnce board for laying out evidence found
- Evidence window, which acts in the same way as "cases" and "People" but for evidence instead.
- Maybe a dedicated message zone for detective-based communications

# To be fixed
- Sync doesn't work correctly
- Map interface does work to an extent but not in the way envisioned
- Side buttons have two textures
- Window can be rezied unproportionally to the content it holds
- Staff window has intended features missing

# Sidenotes

I'm aware there's no doubt better ways to do stuff in LUA, however I am no expert and it works for now.
